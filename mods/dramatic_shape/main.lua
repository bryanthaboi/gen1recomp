-- Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Nothing here reaches collision, movement, triggers or scripts.  Voxel
-- mode is purely presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.

-- `ctx.width/height` are the window measured in LOVE UNITS
-- (love.graphics.getDimensions), but the engine composites a pipeline's
-- returned canvas with `draw(canvas, 0, 0, 0, 1/dpiX, 1/dpiY)` -- a scale
-- that only covers the window when the canvas is at PIXEL resolution.
-- Sizing it in units costs the DPI scale TWICE: the canvas is that much
-- smaller, then it is drawn that much smaller again, so the diorama lands
-- in the top-left corner at 1/dpi of the screen.  Desktop never sees it --
-- units and pixels are the same thing there -- but on Android the DPI scale
-- is the display density (2.625 on a 420dpi panel), and the world came out
-- a third of the size in each direction.
--
-- So ask for the pixel dimensions rather than trusting the ctx.  That is
-- the number a fixed engine would hand over, so this keeps working either
-- way instead of double-correcting.  It also squares the FX pass: ctx.scale
-- is ALREADY in pixels per world pixel (Zoom.scale over Renderer:fitScale,
-- which measures the drawable), so the closures ctx.drawFx runs were being
-- scaled for a canvas 2.6x bigger than the one they drew into.

--   6  T-SHIFT  cycle the blur ladder        (was 9)
--   7  V-CURVE  cycle the horizon bend       (new)
--   8  3D-BTL   toggle overworld battles     (new)
--
-- Only 6 arrives by the documented route. Game:keypressed answers the
-- engine's own display keys FIRST and returns -- 2 COLORS, 3 TILT, 4 ZOOM,
-- 5 GBC FX -- and only then offers the key to Pipelines.hotkey, expressly
-- so "a pipeline can never shadow one" (Schemas, render_pipelines.hotkey).
-- 3 and 5 are two of those, and 7 and 8 belong to plain mod settings that
-- own no pass and so have no registry to claim a key from at all.
--
-- So this wraps Game:keypressed. It is the invasive option and it is the
-- only one: polling the keyboard in update() would fire alongside the
-- engine's handler rather than instead of it, so 3 would cycle this mode
-- AND the engine's TILT on the same press.
--
-- Consequences worth being explicit about: while this mod is enabled, TILT
-- (3) and GBC FX (5) are unreachable by key. Both are still reachable on
-- the OPTIONS menu, and TILT is the one this mode supersedes anyway -- the
-- registry already forces it off whenever a world pipeline takes the pass.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here
-- too, so the work is DELEGATED rather than reimplemented: Pipelines.hotkey
-- applies its own gate and ladder, and the three lines after it are the
-- engine's own (syncOptions, the tilt exclusion, writeOptions).

-- refresh, not invalidate: the stale mesh keeps drawing while the

--
--   Cut          swaps the tree block and rebuilds the 2D renderer
--   the regrowth restores those blocks when the map is re-entered
--   card-key doors are stamped closed on floor load
--
-- all of them writing the block layer directly. Meshes derived from that
-- layer went stale with no announcement -- the cut tree stayed standing,
-- and after a round trip through a door the stump stayed cut because this
-- map's mesh survives in the cache (that is what prevLive is for).
--
-- The engine could announce each of those, and an earlier cut of this
-- work changed it to. That is the wrong place: it edits the game for one
-- mod's benefit, and every future path that writes a block has to

-- already built by the time the next frame draws.

-- every palette toggle. Mesh builds are asynchronous, so the frames between
-- the drop and the first finished mesh have no terrain to draw, and
-- drawWorld returning nil IS the 2D fallback. Keeping the geometry lets the
-- new colours land on the diorama already on screen, in one frame, which is
-- what a palette toggle should look like from inside voxel mode.

-- settings FULL owns stayed visible until the menu was closed and reopened,
-- and a player who stepped off FULL could not see the rows come back.
--
-- Rebuilt in place, and only on a step that changes the LIST: crossing FULL,
-- or toggling 3D-BTL, which is the other row that owns one (BATTLE LAYOUT).
-- Every other rung returns the same list, and rebuilding on all of them would
-- rerun every mod's ui.options.rows hook once per keypress. The cursor is
-- clamped rather than reset, so it stays on the row it was just used on
-- instead of jumping to the top when the list below it shortens.

-- so this file keeps naming every engine seam the mod touches.

-- The overworld's own pushBattle is the choke point for a wild encounter or
-- a trainer, and it is wrapped. A battle that arrives some other way -- a
-- link battle, a script pushing a BattleState directly -- reaches this
-- instead, which stages the arena from wherever the player is standing.
-- Nothing visible is lost by being late: the cull only has to beat the
-- battle screen, and the wipe those battles skip is where it would have
-- shown.

-- the battle screen would have used the back one. The engine's own
-- pokemon.sprite hook is the seam for exactly this: it is asked for every
-- battle pic with the side it is resolving, so swapping one side's answer
-- needs no battle code at all -- and every path that builds a battler goes
-- through it, including a Transform mid-fight.
--
-- next() first, so a sprite-replacing mod loaded before this one still gets
-- the last word on WHICH art is used; this only changes which SIDE is asked
-- for.

-- the black, and the map fades up. The two seams it needs -- BattleState:finish
-- and Renderer:endFrame -- and the reasoning for each live in lib/BattleExit.lua.
--
-- Declared as a transitions record rather than a constant in that file, so the
-- fade is retunable in data exactly like the eight wipes it answers, and a total
-- conversion can make it as long or as short as its own pacing wants.

-- the bytes hit disk -- and read back whenever a save is opened or begun. A
-- save with no clock in it starts at day; that is DayNight.restore's

-- the map.palette hook (ctx.tod) and music.select, so a palette or music
-- pack keyed to night works with this mod's clock for free. next() first: a
-- mod loaded before this one that already moved the time keeps its answer.
